# Techathon 2026 - Office Energy Monitor

A real-time office energy monitoring system for the Techathon Nationals Hackathon preliminary round.

The project goal is to monitor office lights and fans through one shared backend, a live animated web dashboard, and a Discord bot. The system uses simulated IoT device data because no physical hardware is required for the preliminary round.

## Problem Understanding

The office runs daily coordination through Discord, but lights and fans are often left running after people leave. The required solution should let users:

- See every room's lights and fans on a live dashboard.
- Track current power usage across the office and per room.
- Receive alerts for suspicious or wasteful usage.
- Ask a Discord bot for status and usage without opening the dashboard.

The problem statement has one device-count conflict:

- It defines 3 rooms.
- Each room has 2 fans and 3 lights.
- That means 15 total devices.
- Later text mentions 18 devices.

This project follows the fixed room/device definition: 15 devices total.

## Required Features

- Shared backend as the single source of truth.
- Simulated dynamic device data.
- Real-time dashboard updates without page refresh.
- Live device status grouped by room.
- Live total and per-room power usage.
- Active alerts panel.
- Discord bot commands:
  - `!status`
  - `!room <name>`
  - `!usage`
  - `!alerts`
  - `!devices`
  - `!offhours`
- System architecture diagram.
- Representative hardware/electrical schematic for one room.
- Clear setup and run instructions.
- Short demo video.

## Target Architecture

![System architecture](docs/assets/system-architecture.svg)

Both the dashboard and Discord bot must read from the same backend state. The bot must not generate independent random data.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend/backend: Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript
- UI: Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- Charts: Recharts through shadcn chart components
- Icons: Tabler Icons
- Animation: CSS/SVG animations
- Shared state: Next.js API route with InstantDB snapshot support
- Discord bot: discord.js
- Data source: deterministic simulated IoT device layer
- Hardware concept: Wokwi ESP32 relay/sensing circuit

## Dashboard Experience

The dashboard includes:

- Top-view layout with Drawing Room, Work Room 1, and Work Room 2.
- Lights glow when on.
- Fans spin when running.
- Room-level power cards.
- Animated total watt meter.
- Alerts visible at a glance.
- Device list grouped by room.
- Analytics page with live trend, room comparison, and fan/light split.
- Discord bot page with command set and live response preview.
- Architecture page with system and hardware diagrams.

Routes:

```text
/              live overview and SVG floor plan
/devices       device registry with runtime and last-changed fields
/alerts        alert rules and active alert timeline
/analytics     live charts and session peak load
/architecture  system diagram and one-room schematic
/bot           Discord command guide and live preview
```

## Backend Data Model

Each simulated device should include:

```ts
type Device = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: "fan" | "light";
  room: "drawing-room" | "work-room-1" | "work-room-2";
  status: "on" | "off";
  watts: number;
  lastChanged: string;
  onSince?: string;
};
```

The simulator updates device states over time and serves the full state through the shared backend endpoint.

## API

```text
GET /api/state
```

The dashboard polls this endpoint for demo-safe real-time updates, and the Discord bot reads the same endpoint for command responses.

## Alert Rules

- Device on after office hours, assuming office hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
- All devices in one room on for more than 2 hours.
- Optional: unusually high total watt usage.

## Discord Bot Behavior

The bot should answer with concise, human-friendly messages from live backend data.

Example commands:

```text
!status
!room drawing
!room work1
!room work2
!usage
!alerts
!devices
!offhours
```

Bonus behavior: proactively post to a configured channel when a new alert appears.

- Wokwi sketch: [wokwi/sketch.ino](wokwi/sketch.ino)

## Team Contribution Plan

All four team members should contribute real artifacts:

- Developer: backend, dashboard, Discord bot, deployment.
- Documentation owner: README, setup guide, screenshots, submission checklist.
- Systems owner: architecture diagram and data-flow explanation.
- Hardware/demo owner: schematic explanation, demo script, testing checklist, video.

See [docs/team-contributions.md](docs/team-contributions.md) for details.

## Important Rulebook Notes

- Repository must be public.
- Repository should be created after the problem statement release.
- Code must be original and attributed where needed.
- AI coding assistants are allowed.
- README must explain setup, architecture, technologies, API endpoints, and AI integration details if used.
- Final submission includes GitHub link, demo video link, and team details.

## Current Status

The dashboard and Discord bot are implemented as separate packages. The dashboard exposes the shared live state API, and the bot reads from that same endpoint. The repo also includes SVG diagrams and a representative Wokwi circuit for the hardware deliverable.
